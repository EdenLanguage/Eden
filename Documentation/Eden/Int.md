Int is 32-bit numeric value written in two's complement that takes into account negative numbers. To declare variable use syntax:
```Var Int variable = 10i; ```
Or 
```Var Int variable = 10; ```
Letter `i`  on the end is **optional** and is used to indicate [[Int]] type to interpreter. See [[Variable declaration]] for more info about that.
