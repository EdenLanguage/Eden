When defining variables as literals in code you must know about type indicators. They are used to define type of literal with concrete type and they are necessary when declaring variable. For example:
`Var Int integer = 10i;`
`Var Float pi = 3.14f;`
`Var Char symbol = 10c;`
To put it simply, just remember to type `c` when defining [[Char]], `i` when constructing [[Int]] and `f` when defining [[Float]].
