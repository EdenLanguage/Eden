- **[[Int]]**: A 32-bit signed integer that can represent both positive and negative whole numbers.
- **[[Char]]**: An 8-bit unsigned integer used to store individual characters, with values ranging from 0 to 255.
- **[[List]]**: An array of characters, representing a sequence of characters (text).
- **[[Float]]**: A 16-bit floating-point number used to represent decimal values.
- **[[Bool]]**: A logical type with two possible values: `True` or `False`.
- **[[None]]**: A placeholder for future use in custom types, similar to `void` in other languages.
