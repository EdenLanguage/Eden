A logical type (boolean) can be declared using the `Var` keyword, just like other variable types. The two possible values for a `Bool` are `True` and `False`.
### Example:
```
Var Bool flag = True;  // Declares a boolean variable with value True.
```

## Logical Values
- `True` and `False` are keywords that represent the two possible values of a `Bool`.
- These keywords are used in logical expressions to evaluate conditions.
## Logical Operators
You can use standard logical operators with `Bool` values, such as:
- `&&` (AND)
- `||` (OR)
- `==` (Equality)
- `!=` (Inequality)
- `<` (Less than)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
These operators return a `Bool` type value when applied to expressions.

### Examples:
```
If (10i == 10i) {  // '==' operator results in a Bool value, which is 'True' in this case.     
	// Logic here will be executed if the condition is true. 
};
```
```
Var Bool equal = (100i != 50i);  // The '!=' operator results in a Bool value, which is 'True'
```
