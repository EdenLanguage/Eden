An expression is a basic evaluation of language-type values. For example:
```
5i + 5i  // Results in 10i
"Name" + "Surname"  // Results in "NameSurname"
10i + 3.14f  // Results in a floating-point number
```
An expression always results in a new value. Depending on the operator used, the resulting value can be of type [[Bool]] or any other supported [[Types]] in Eden.
