Eden provides several operators:
- `==` (equal) – Returns a [[Bool]] value based on argument comparison.
- `!=` (not equal)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<` (less than)
- `>` (greater than)
- `%` (modulo) – Returns the remainder of a division operation.
- `&&` (logical AND)
- `||` (logical OR)
- `?` - Question -  Returns True if expression is default value. Example: `?5 == False` because default value for Int is `0`.
- `!` - Negation - Negates expression. Example: `!5 == -5`.
- `~` - Reverse - Flips bits of expression: Example: `!True == False`. For now only [[Int]] type is implemented, and in that case result would be `~10 == -11` because of two's complement. But in future other types like [[UInt]] will be added and in that case `~10 == 4294967285`. It is important to point out that [[Int]] is 32-bit.
