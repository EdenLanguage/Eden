### Operators
- Unary
	- ? - Question -  Returns True if expression is default value. Example: ?5 == False because default value for Int is 0.
	- ! - Negation - Negates expression. Example: !5 == -5.
	- ~ - Reverse - Flips bits of expression: Example: !True == False.
		- For now only [[Int]] type is implemented, and in that case result would be ~10 == -11 because of two's complement. But in future other types like [[UInt]] will be added and in that case ~10 == 4294967285. It is important to point out that [[Int]] is 32-bit.
