List of [[Variables]]. To declare variable in [[Eden]] language use folowing syntax:
`Var Int variable = 10i;`
Letter `i` on the end of the number is optional and interpreter will work fine if you abandon it. But it improves readability if you use it. Just like [[Int]] you can declare other types like [[Long]] and in that case use syntax:
`Var Long variable = 10ii`
